# 2x2 Rubiks Cube Solver

## Functionality:

This project attempts to find algorithms to solve a rubiks cube.
The top left corner piece will be locked in to prevent duplicates.

Searching for an algorithm will be done from solved state and scrambled state
to meet in the middle, reducing state generations
